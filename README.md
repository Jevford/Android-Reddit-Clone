# Android-Reddit-Clone

This project was updated from a previous course taken at UCI.  The program runs within an android emulator using IntelliJ for testing purposes.
The goal of this project was to create a mobile Reddit Clone with CRUD functionality using Java, Android SDKs, and Google Firebase.

## Features:
- Working mobile front-end that responds similarly to haptic touch feedback.
- Ability to add, comment, like, dislike, and delete posts are implemented.
- Data was stored in a Google Firebase database.  (Database is now out of commission since it was linked to my uci account.)
